[00:15.23] City girls just seem to find out early
[00:22.04] How to open doors with just a smile
[00:29.24] A rich old man and she won't have to worry
[00:36.41] She'll dress up all in lace and go in style.
[00:58.41] 
[00:43.76] Late at night a big old house gets lonely
[00:50.28] I guess ev'ry form of refuge has it's price
[00:58.06] And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
[01:05.30] Given to a man with hands as cold as ice.
[01:25.80] 
[01:12.47] So she tells him she must go out for the evening
[01:19.35] To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
[01:26.58] But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
[01:34.04] She is headed for the cheatin' side of town.
[01:56.04] 
[01:40.22] You can't hide your lyin' eyes
[01:47.92] And your smile is a thin disguise
[01:55.08] I thought by now you'd realize
[02:02.77] There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes.
[02:24.27] 
[02:21.04] On the other side of town a boy is waiting
[02:28.46] With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
[02:35.15] She drives on through the night anticipating
[02:42.34] 'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel.
[03:07.34] 
[02:49.60] She rushes to his arms, they fall together
[02:56.86] She whispers that it's only for awhile
[03:04.01] She swears that soon she'll be comin' back forever
[03:11.37] She pulls away and leaves him with a smile.
[03:32.87] 
[03:18.23] You can't hid your lyin' eyes
[03:24.98] And your smile is a thin disguise
[03:32.11] I thought by now you'd realize
[03:40.24] There ain't now way to hide you lyin' eyes.
[04:01.74] 
[03:58.32] She gets up and pours herself a strong one
[04:05.51] And stares out at the stars up in the sky
[04:13.36] Another night, it's gonna be a long one
[04:19.96] She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry.
[04:42.96] 
[04:27.16] She wonders how it ever got this crazy
[04:34.31] She thinks about a boy she knew in school
[04:41.67] Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
[04:48.82] She's so far gone she feels just like a fool.
[05:11.32] 
[04:56.19] My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
[05:03.34] You set it up so well, so carefully
[05:10.42] Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
[05:17.77] You're still the same old girl you used to be.
[05:40.77] 
[05:24.69] You can't hide your lyin' eyes
[05:31.40] And your smile is a thin disguise
[05:38.51] I thought by now you'd realize
[05:46.22] There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes.
[06:07.72] 
[05:53.92] There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes.
[06:01.20] Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes...
